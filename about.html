    Hi, my name is Jack Meyer I'm currently a Software
    Engineering student and a future Software Developer. I am a motivated,
    passionate, and outgoing student at Iowa State University. I'm in
    my third year and I'm majoring in Software Engineering.
    My current interests are in application development, especially
    within the healthcare industry.

    I grew up in New Prague, Minnesota; a town of about 7,500 people.
    My childhood was spent on the basketball court and in the woods
    at my cabin in Northern Minnesota. I attended New Prague High School,
    where I became even more involved in the basketball program.
    My last two years I was a Student Assistant Coach on the team.
    Coaching taught me how to be a leader and an effective communicator.
    During high school I also challenged myself in the classroom by
    taking AP courses and college courses which were offered through
    a college in the school program. By challenging myself in high
    school and being active in extracurricular activities, I learned
    I graduated high school in June 2014 and I started attending Iowa State
    University in the fall of that year.

</p>
    At Iowa State University, I chose to major in Software Engineering.
    As I started my classwork, I fell in love with developing software.
    I enjoy critically thinking and became addicted to the feeling
    of success after solving a difficult problem.

    This past summer, I had an amazing experience at my internship.
    I was a Programmer Analyst Intern at
    <a href="http://www.telligen.com/" target="_blank">Telligen</a>
    in West Des Moines, Iowa. I worked on the
    <a href="https://www.emeasuretool.cms.gov/" target="_blank">CMS Measure Authoring Tool</a>,
    implementing new features which will be included in future
    releases!
 </p>

<p>
    Today, I am very active within the Software Engineering Program.
    This upcoming year I will be serving as president of the
    <a href="https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/cse" target="_blank">Computer Science and Software Engineering Club</a>
    at Iowa State and a Peer Mentor for the
    <a href="https://www.se.iastate.edu/learning-community" target="_blank">Software Engineering Learning Community</a>.
    I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to reach out to so many students,
    especially freshmen, through the Computer Science and Software Engineering
    Club and the Learning Community. I hope to pass along my passion
    and excitement for the field of software engineering.
