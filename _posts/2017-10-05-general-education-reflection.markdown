# A reflection
Over the course of my 4 years at Iowa State, I have taken many general education courses which helped change and shape my world view and understand engineering problems and how the world may or may not view the solution. As a Software Engineer, the products we create have the ability to change the way people interact with the world, see the world, and use the world. It is important that we are well versed in many different subject areas so we c an fully understand the people that are using our products.

Throughout my career as an engineer, I hope that I have the ability to create solutions which are going to enable people to do things in their lives in ways that they were previously not able to. Right now, my current passion is in healthcare and I hope to create solutions which are going to decrease the cost of medical care, while at the same time raise the standards of care. I hope to work in an environment where everyone shares these goals and where everyone has a passion for developing unique, cutting edge solutions in the healthcare field. I hope to work in a fast-paced paced environment, where we are able to act on changing requirements quickly and efficiently, an environment where people push others to succeed rather than working for their own gain, and an environment which is collaborative, lighthearted, and welcoming.

Taking general education courses have helped me understand the worldview of other people and understand where their views come from. I took a class about the different religions in the United States. This class helped me understand many different religions, and different religions symbols and values. I also took a post-civil war history class which allowed me to get an understanding of how modern America was shaped and what the core values the people in our country have. Finally, I took a philosophy course which allowed to understand the different way people think. These courses allowed me to view an engineering problem in ways that I was not able to before. I can think of a problem and a solution and have a better understanding of how different people interact with the solution. I have more of an understanding of the needs and wants of different people in society and I am able to apply those to the problem I am trying to solve.

I have also learned how to effectively communicate about the problem and solution. Through a technical writing course and speech course, I have gained the skills needed to write clear and concise thoughts. As an engineer, it is important to be able to be able to reason about problems and solution, write about them, and discuss the solution.

When solving engineering problems, it is important to understand how other members of society will view the product. It is also important to understand what people value and what they need, and how the solution can eliminate the user’s needs while making sure to not infringe on their value system. It is always important to consider gender, race, and religion and ensure that any solution doesn’t violate any values that different people of different background may have. Some software engineering application may reach a global audience, so it is important to consider cultures outside my own. My general education classes helped me understand what people from the other parts of the world may be thinking as well.

Overall, my general education classes have had a positive impact on my life inside and outside of engineering. I have gained a clearer picture about different cultures, religions, and genders; different ways of thinking; and United States history.  Finally, I’ve learned how to more effectively communicate my thoughts in writing and in speech.
