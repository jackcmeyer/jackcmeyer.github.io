Salon Manager is a business solution developed for a client to help manager
and organize business expenses, appointments, and client information. This
project was designed with small businesses in mind. Salon Manager provides
a "dashboard"-style UI which allows the user to view all of their information
in one glance. The goal of the project was to eliminate paper and pen business
tracking for small businesses who could not afford to upgrade to an expensive
business solution.

Salon Manager was originally built on Node.js, Angular1, and MongoDB. It also
allows the Google Calendar API to ease the stress of scheduling clients and
allow the user to take their calendar on the road. However, Salon Manager is
currently undergoing a renovation which will give a better user experience
and be easier to maintain in the future. The new Salon Manager will be built
on Spring Boot, Angular 2, and MySQL.

Though this project, I gained valuable experience in building production
worthy applications. I like to say this is the project where I learned "what
not to do" and look forward to continuing the rewrite of the project to get
it to the next level.
