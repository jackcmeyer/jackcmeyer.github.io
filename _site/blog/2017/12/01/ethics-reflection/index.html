<h1 id="a-reflection">A reflection</h1>
<p>If I were an engineer on the Volkswagen project, I would have tried my hardest to make sure that no ethical violations were happening. To make sure that didn’t happen, I would have tried the following steps to ensure that no violations were happening. First, I would have talked to my direct manager about my findings. I would start here, to make sure that my manager is aware of the issue. If I were to deem that my manager is in on the scheme, then I would go to the HR department of the company. If the HR department doesn’t listen to my concerns, then I would go seek legal help. In the meantime, I would refuse to implement anything that surrounds this algorithm. I would hope that my manager was unaware of what was happening because of naivety and would help resolve the problem. However, if the manager was in on it, I would hope that HR would help out and do what is in the best interest of the company and protect themselves against potential ethical violations. If neither party was willing to help solve the problem, then I would seek legal help and have them bring action against the company to stop the unethical and illegal actions.</p>

<p>I believe that the engineers at Volkswagen continued to implement algorithms they knew were unethical because they had no other options. For example, there might have been clauses in contracts that prevented them from talking to anybody about things that happened at work. This might have scared off many engineers in talking to people outside of the company. Next, there was probably a toxic relationship between developers and middle managers which prevented the engineers from talking with their managers. Without a good relationship between developers and managers, it would be very hard for developers to communicate concerns about the company’s direction and decisions to their manager. Finally, there was probably a lack of options for communicating with the HR department of the company. The engineers probably felt that the HR department was not going to help the engineer and protect the company rather than the employee. They probably felt that if they were to talk to anyone within the company about this ethical violation, they would lose their jobs. This caused everyone to stay quiet and just do the work they were told to do. Which resulted in a huge ethical violation.</p>
