        <title>A Reflection: The Volkswagen Ethical Scandal</title>
        <description>
A reflection
If I were an engineer on the Volkswagen project, I would have tried my hardest to make sure that no ethical violations were happening. To make sure that didn’t happen, I would have tried the following steps to ensure that no violations were happening. First, I would have talked to my direct manager about my findings. I would start here, to make sure that my manager is aware of the issue. If I were to deem that my manager is in on the scheme, then I would go to the HR department of the company. If the HR department doesn’t listen to my concerns, then I would go seek legal help. In the meantime, I would refuse to implement anything that surrounds this algorithm. I would hope that my manager was unaware of what was happening because of naivety and would help resolve the problem. However, if the manager was in on it, I would hope that HR would help out and do what is in the best interest of the company and protect themselves against potential ethical violations. If neither party was willing to help solve the problem, then I would seek legal help and have them bring action against the company to stop the unethical and illegal actions.

I believe that the engineers at Volkswagen continued to implement algorithms they knew were unethical because they had no other options. For example, there might have been clauses in contracts that prevented them from talking to anybody about things that happened at work. This might have scared off many engineers in talking to people outside of the company. Next, there was probably a toxic relationship between developers and middle managers which prevented the engineers from talking with their managers. Without a good relationship between developers and managers, it would be very hard for developers to communicate concerns about the company’s direction and decisions to their manager. Finally, there was probably a lack of options for communicating with the HR department of the company. The engineers probably felt that the HR department was not going to help the engineer and protect the company rather than the employee. They probably felt that if they were to talk to anyone within the company about this ethical violation, they would lose their jobs. This caused everyone to stay quiet and just do the work they were told to do. Which resulted in a huge ethical violation.

        <title>A Reflection: My General Education at Iowa State University</title>
        <description>
A reflection
Over the course of my 4 years at Iowa State, I have taken many general education courses which helped change and shape my world view and understand engineering problems and how the world may or may not view the solution. As a Software Engineer, the products we create have the ability to change the way people interact with the world, see the world, and use the world. It is important that we are well versed in many different subject areas so we c an fully understand the people that are using our products.

Throughout my career as an engineer, I hope that I have the ability to create solutions which are going to enable people to do things in their lives in ways that they were previously not able to. Right now, my current passion is in healthcare and I hope to create solutions which are going to decrease the cost of medical care, while at the same time raise the standards of care. I hope to work in an environment where everyone shares these goals and where everyone has a passion for developing unique, cutting edge solutions in the healthcare field. I hope to work in a fast-paced paced environment, where we are able to act on changing requirements quickly and efficiently, an environment where people push others to succeed rather than working for their own gain, and an environment which is collaborative, lighthearted, and welcoming.

Taking general education courses have helped me understand the worldview of other people and understand where their views come from. I took a class about the different religions in the United States. This class helped me understand many different religions, and different religions symbols and values. I also took a post-civil war history class which allowed me to get an understanding of how modern America was shaped and what the core values the people in our country have. Finally, I took a philosophy course which allowed to understand the different way people think. These courses allowed me to view an engineering problem in ways that I was not able to before. I can think of a problem and a solution and have a better understanding of how different people interact with the solution. I have more of an understanding of the needs and wants of different people in society and I am able to apply those to the problem I am trying to solve.

I have also learned how to effectively communicate about the problem and solution. Through a technical writing course and speech course, I have gained the skills needed to write clear and concise thoughts. As an engineer, it is important to be able to be able to reason about problems and solution, write about them, and discuss the solution.

When solving engineering problems, it is important to understand how other members of society will view the product. It is also important to understand what people value and what they need, and how the solution can eliminate the user’s needs while making sure to not infringe on their value system. It is always important to consider gender, race, and religion and ensure that any solution doesn’t violate any values that different people of different background may have. Some software engineering application may reach a global audience, so it is important to consider cultures outside my own. My general education classes helped me understand what people from the other parts of the world may be thinking as well.

Overall, my general education classes have had a positive impact on my life inside and outside of engineering. I have gained a clearer picture about different cultures, religions, and genders; different ways of thinking; and United States history.  Finally, I’ve learned how to more effectively communicate my thoughts in writing and in speech.

        <title>Smart Sync</title>
        <description>
SmartSync is a home management system for synchronizing Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, family members’ online accounts, and other user applications. It runs
as a web application, interfacing with various services to provide a more
efficient home for the modern family. A “dashboard”-style user interface
lets the family see the status of their household at a glance. The goal of the
project was to provide a platform that allows user’s to synchronize and manage
multiple IoT devices and services. SmartSync uses a dashboard style webpage
which allows the user to view that status of multiple devices/services
simultaneously.

Throughout the course of this project, we had to consider several different
aspects. We had to consider how to design an software architecture that was
capable of interfacing with many third-party services. Another design challenge
of this project was surrounding the microservice architecture. This was a
foreign concept to the team going into this project, but we quickly learned
how to manage and configure several services running in a distributed way. We
chose the microservice architecture because it gave us the flexibility to
interface with all of of the services we needed to and allowed us to deploy
new changes and features without worrying about breaking unrelated parts
of the project.

This project was built on Spring Boot, Angular 2, and the microservice
architecture. We designed an API which allows all of the components of the
project to communicate with one another.

        <title>Salon Manager</title>
        <description>
Salon Manager is a business solution developed for a client to help manager
and organize business expenses, appointments, and client information. This
project was designed with small businesses in mind. Salon Manager provides
a “dashboard”-style UI which allows the user to view all of their information
in one glance. The goal of the project was to eliminate paper and pen business
tracking for small businesses who could not afford to upgrade to an expensive
business solution.

Salon Manager was originally built on Node.js, Angular1, and MongoDB. It also
allows the Google Calendar API to ease the stress of scheduling clients and
allow the user to take their calendar on the road. However, Salon Manager is
currently undergoing a renovation which will give a better user experience
and be easier to maintain in the future. The new Salon Manager will be built
on Spring Boot, Angular 2, and MySQL.

Though this project, I gained valuable experience in building production
worthy applications. I like to say this is the project where I learned “what
not to do” and look forward to continuing the rewrite of the project to get
it to the next level.

        <title>Wikipedia Quick Search</title>
        <description>
Wikipedia quick search is a Chrome Extension which allows users to highlight
a word on a webpage and do a quick Wikipedia search. It opens up Wikipedia
in a popup window and allows the user to see what they searched for. It is
perfect for searching people, places, teams, and events. This is the perfect
tool for when you are browsing web pages and you don’t know something in an
article.

Since it is a Chrome Extension, it uses the Chrome Message Passing API to allow
the extension to communicate with the webpage. It injects a Content Script
into the current webpage to allow the value of the highlighted text to be sent
back to the extension.

When designing this tool, speed and a minimalist design were the goals. The UI
needed to be something that did not impact the what the user was looking at on
their main screen and it needed the search needed to be fast to actually be
useful. This is why directly searching the Wikipedia website and using a
popup window were the best choices.
